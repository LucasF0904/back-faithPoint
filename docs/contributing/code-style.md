# Code Style

We want to ensure that our code is consistent and easy to read, so we ask that contributors follow these guidelines:

* Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to enforce code style and formatting.
* Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.
* Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking.
* Use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to document your code.
* Use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) for commit messages.

We also recommend following the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) as a general guide for writing clean and consistent code.

If you have any questions or suggestions for improving our code style, please create an issue in the project's issue tracker.
